      <description>Introduction This dataset, “heart”, was found on kaggle.com. The data was collected in a hospital from 303 willing participants; the goal was to find possible trends in order to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health. It originially featured a set of 14 attributes that play a role in heart disease. Some of these variables were removed and some were renamed in order to create a dataset that is readily usable for this project.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the following document, two separate data sets, both of which were found from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday, will be combined and examined.
The first dataset, named “global_mortality” contains mortality data for 228 political entities (mostly independent countries) for all years between 1990-2016. In this dataset, the mortality rate from 32 distinct factors is recorded as a percentage of the total deaths for each year in each country. In the second dataset, named “lifeexp”, 241 political entities (which I will refer to as countries, for simplicity), are presented along with the life expectancy of each country for years 1950-2015.</description>
